### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Micah, a fourth year Computer Science major and recently retired [NCAA swimmer](https://athletics.sfu.ca/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/micah-lau/4908) at Simon Fraser University!
I am currently in the middle of an 8-month internship at [FORM](https://ca.formswim.com/) and also learning how to exercise without a coach (I'd appreciate any tips you have)!
