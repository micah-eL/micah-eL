### Hi there 👋

I'm Micah, a Computer Science major and retired [NCAA swimmer](https://athletics.sfu.ca/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving/roster/micah-lau/4908) at Simon Fraser University! Since retiring from varsity swimming, I've interned as a software engineer at [FORM](https://ca.formswim.com/) (2x), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/). I'm set to graduate in 2024 and am open to hearing about exciting new opportunities! 

After learning a variety of different stacks during my internships at FORM (`Python`, `Typescript`/`Javascript`), I've focused my attention on product backend or infra roles - at Coinbase I worked on the Infrastructure Security team (`Golang`, `Python`), at LinkedIn I worked on the Content Platform team for the flagship app (`Java`), and at Amazon I worked on DocumentDB's core engine software (`C`/`C++`).
